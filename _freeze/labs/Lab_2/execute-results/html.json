Reproducible reports seamlessly integrate code and narrative within the same document in order to allow others to easily replicate your results by running the embedded code.\n\nQuarto documents can be set up to produce (render) reports in various formats including pdf, html, MS Word, among others.\n\n***Note:*** If you are using the desktop version of quarto, you will need to download quarto from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/> before you proceed.\n\n## Installing Packages\n\nIn today's lab, we will need the `openintro` and `tidyverse` packages. You should have these packages already but in case you don't, you will need to install them first. To install a package run the command below [in the console]{style=\"color:red\"}. Replace the `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install.\n\n``` toml\ninstall.packages(\"package_name\")\n```\n\nAn alternative way to install a package in RStudio is to use the `install` button in the packages tab.\n\n## Creating a quarto file\n\nTo create your First Quarto file, follow the following steps:\n\nGo to File\\>New File \\> Quarto document. See below:\n\n![](images/a2.jpeg){width=\"90%\"}\n\nAfter clicking Quarto document,a pop up window will appear with fields for the title and author. Enter the title of the document as `Introducing Quarto and Data Wrangling` because that is what we are doing today.\n\nWrite your name in the `author` field. The output format can stay as HTML. You can always change these options even after creating the document. The popup window looks as follows:\n\n![](images/a3.jpeg){width=\"70%\"}\n\nClick create to create the document. Note that the document appears with the name Untitled. Click on `file` then navigate to `save` then change the name to `Lab_02`. Remember, we do not want to use a space for the document name. Click on save. Your document should appear under the files section with the name `Lab_02.qmd` (notice that you do not type the `.qmd` part, it automatically comes). With this document saved here, you can always return to it any time and continue working.\n\nWhen you look at the body of the document, you will note that the it has both plain text and some code chunks. Anything that you want interpreted as code goes into the code chunks. Otherwise, you can use the white space outside code chunks. Note, however, that you can still comment out stuff that you do not want to run as code inside code chunks using the hash tag.\n\nTo add your own code chunk at a given location in the document, place the cursor these, then click on `code` then go to add new `chunk`. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `cmd+opt+I` on a MacOS and `control+opt+I` on Windows PCs.\n\nBy default, the code chunks are for R code. Quarto supports other languages such as `python`, and `julia`. To use other languages, verify that it is supported, then change the `r` to python (you may have to click on `source` to see the architecture of code chunks.\n\n## Notes on Rendering\n\n-   When you are ready to generate your report, you click on the `render` button. Put this to the test by clicking on the render button. Study the report. If you want any changes, you make them in the source file (quarto), then click on render to see the results. It takes a while to become good with editing quarto documents, but most of that stuff is easily found online.\n\n-   When you render a quarto document, quarto outputs your report by running all code chunks ***sequentially*** from top to bottom. All operations in code chunks should be laid out in the right order. For example, if operation A must run before operation B, the code chunk in which operation A runs should come before the code chunk in which operation B runs.\n\n-   Operations such as installing packages that [should be done only in the console]{style=\"color:red\"}. If any code chunk has code for package installation, quarto will try to install the package every time you render the document (imagine if you had to install TikTok on your phone evry time you needed to use it!!).\n\n-   Operations such as activating (waking up) packages, i.e., `library(package name)`, can be included in the code chunks.\n\n## Tidyverse Framework\n\nThe tidyverse is a collection of open-source R packages that help with data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. In the first lab, our code was mostly base R (not Tidyverse). In this lab, you be introduced to the `tidyverse` as a framework for working with data structures in R. Although we will use Tidyverse for most of this lab and future labs, there are certain commands that are easier to do in base R. So, expect to see both Tidyverse and base R code from time to time.\n\n## The Structre of a Quarto Document\n\n### YAML\n\nThe top portion of your quarto file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data representation for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n### Packages\n\nWe will use the first code chunk to load (activate) any packages that are needed for a specific quarto document. For example, to day, we will need the following packages: `openintro` and `tidyverse`. Copy and paste the following code in the **first** code chunk:\n\n``` toml\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\nRun the code chunk with the packages to ensure that they are all working. If any of them is missing, R will prompt you to install them. Go ahead and do so.\n\n## Loading Data\n\nThere are several ways to load data into a quarto document. Today, we will explore the first way - loading data stored in a package (openintro to be specific). Remember that the openintro package contains the data that comes with the openintro text. To view a complete list of the data frames in `openintro`, visit the site <https://www.openintro.org/data/>. Today, we will use a data frame called `nycflights` contained in the `openintro` package. To load this data into your work space, you will use the following command after running the packages.\n\nTo learn more about this data frame, run the following code in the ***nycflights***:\n\n``` toml\ndata(nycflights)\n```\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"nycflights\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the above code, a new object should appear in the environment area. Click on `penguins` to view and study the data.\n\nTo learn more about this data frame, you can run the command `?nycflights` in the console. It is ***very important*** that you do this.\n\n## A little more about Tidyverse\n\nThe creators of the tidyverse noted that it is “an opionated collection of R packages designed for data science.” It’s a suite of packages designed with a consistent philosophy and aesthetic. This is nice because all of the packages are designed to work well together, providing a consistent framework to do many of the most common tasks in R, including, but not limited to…\n\n-   data manipulation (`dplyr`)\n-   reshaping data (`tidyr`)\n-   data visualization (`ggplot`)\n-   working with strings (`stringr`)\n\nIt is important to note that tidyverse functions are designed to be like grammar for their tasks, so we’ll be using functions that are named as verbs to discuss the tidyverse. The idea is that you can string these grammatical elements together to form more complex statements, just like with language.\n\n### Tidyverse Workflow\n\nIn lab_01, we performed the analyses using base R code. We saw that to compute the mean of a given variable in a data frame, you use `data_frame_name$variable_name`.\n\nFor example, to compute the mean of the variable `hour` in the nycflights data, you would write your code as follows:\n\n``` toml\nmean(nycflights$hour)\n```\n\nIn the tidyverse, the code for the mean of the bill length would be\n\n``` toml\nnyflights %>% \nsummarize(avg = mean(hour))\n```\n\nThe symbol `%>%` is called a pipe and is very common in tidyverse. It takes anything on its left and sends it (pipes it) to the function on the right. Here, we are taking the nycflights data frame and piping it into the summarize function (the function for summary statistics). Inside the function, we specify the variable and the statistic (in this case the ***mean***). We have chosen to name the output as `avg` but this could be changed.\n\nYou can compute other summary statistics in a similar manner as above and if there is an NA one way to deal with would be to remove it. In some cases, one would replace NA with the average of the other values.\n\n## Basic Data Wrangling\n\nData wrangling, broadly speaking, means getting your data into a useful form for visualizing and modelling it. Hadley Wickham, who has developed a lot of the tidyverse, conceptualizes the main steps involved in data wrangling as follows:\n\n-   Importing your data\n-   Tidying your data\n-   Transforming your data\n\nData is considered tidy if\n\n-   Each variable has its own column\n-   Each observation/case has its own row\n-   Each value has its own cell.\n\nThe figure below illustrate the idea of tidy data:\n\n![](images/tidy.jpeg){width=\"70%\"}\n\nIf your data is not already in tidy format when you import it, you can use functions from the `tidyR` package, e.g. `gather()` and `spread()`, to “reshape” your data to get it into tidy format.\n\nToday we are going to look at the following important functions: `select()`, `mutate()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `group_by()`, and `drop_na()`.\n\n### select()\n\nThe select function is used to select specific variables (columns) from a larger data set.\n\nThe nycflights data frame has many variables. Suppose we are interested in the variables carrier, origin, arrival delay, and destination only. We achieve this as follows:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnycflights_a <- nycflights %>% \nselect (carrier, arr_delay, dest, origin)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n-   A new object named `nycflights_a` appears in the environment area when you run the above code.\n-   The variable spelling in your code must match the names used in the data frame. This is a common mistake many students make.\n\n### mutate()\n\nThe mutate function alters (mutates) an existing variable in some way and creates a new column(variable) with a name that you designate. Suppose you want to create a new variable called converts the arrival delay to hours (note that it is provided in minutes). You can run the following code:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnycflights_b <- nycflights %>% \n  mutate (arr_delay_hr = arr_delay/60)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n-   After running the above code, the new data frame will have one more variable (at the end). This is the new variable (column) you created. Check it out.\n-   Most mathematical operations can be done as above as long as it makes sense to do so. For example, you cannot perform the divide operation on a variable such as `origin`.\n\n### filter()\n\nJust like we can `select` certain variables (columns) from a data set, it is possible to filter a certain rows (cases/observations) in a data set.\n\nSuppose you have you interested in flights that originated from JFK only. You can achieve this by using the filter function as follows:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnycflights_c <- nycflights %>% \nfilter (origin == \"JFK\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### group_by()\n\nGroup_by is a special kind of filtering that is commonly used alongside a `summarize()` function. For example, suppose you want to compute the average arrival delay by airport. To do this, you first use the group_by function to group the cases by origin, then run the summarize function and call the mean. See code below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnycflights %>% \n  group_by (origin) %>%\n  summarize(avg_arr_delay=mean(arr_delay))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  origin avg_arr_delay\n  <chr>          <dbl>\n1 EWR             9.33\n2 JFK             5.98\n3 LGA             5.71\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can see the delay times by origin airport.\n\n### drop_na()\n\nSome statistics may not be computed with if the variable of interest has missing values (these appear as na in R). In such cases, it might be necessary to drop missing values before moving forward with your analysis. To drop missing values from a given column (variable), you use the drop_na() function as shown below:\n\n``` toml\nname_of_your_choice <- original_data %>% \ndrop_na(variable_name)\n```\n\nIf you want to drop_na from multiple variables, you simply list the variables in the drop_na function separated by commas.\n\n## Exercises\n\nAnswer the following exercises. Be sure to show/explain your work on each question. You can copy and paste each question into the quarto document that you will submit. Have the code chunks below each question that requires code.\n\n1.  ***(4 pts)*** Create a new quarto document with the title \"Basic Data Wrangling\". Save the document as `Lab_02_Exe`. Delete everything on the page EXCEPT the YAML section. In the YAML area change the output format to pdf, and make sure your name is written under author.\n\n2.  ***(4 pts)*** Create a code chunk and load the packages `openintro` and `tidyverse`. Run these packages to make sure they are properly loaded. Next, create a new code chunk and load the a data set called `ames` (this is contained in the `openintro` package). How many variables and how many observations/cases does this data fame have?\n\n3.  ***(4 pts)*** Examine the detailed documentation of this dataset by clicking on the link <https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt>. What does the variable `Bsmt.Qual` measure? Be sure to provide information on each level/value of this variable.\n\n4.  ***(2 pts)*** Create a new data set and save it as `ames_new`. This new data set should have the variables price, `Bsmt.Qual`, and `Lot.Shape` only.\n\n5.  ***(2 pts)*** Determine the number of cases in the `ames_new` data frame that have the value `Gd` for the variable `Bsmt.Qual`. To do this, you may use the `filter()` function.\n\n6.  ***(6 pts)*** Use the group_by() function to create a summary table that shows the average house prices by lot shape (`Lot.Shape`). What can you comment based on this result?\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-important\n### Submission Checklist\n\n-   Attempt all questions\n-   Render your work to pdf.
