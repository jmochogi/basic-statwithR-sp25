This package is contained within the `tidyverse` package (already installed) so we do not need to install it separately. The term `ggplot` stands for \"Grammar of Graphics Plot\" which is a system for declaratively creating graphics. It provides a programmatic interface for specifying **what variables to plot**, how they are **displayed**, and general **visual properties**. The package allows users to create a wide variety of high-quality and customizable statistical graphs, making it a valuable tool for data exploration and presentation.\n\n## [Creating your Quarto File]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nTo create your quarto file, follow the following steps:\n\n-   Go to File\\>New File \\> Quarto document. In the title field use `Introducing ggplot2` then write your name under the `Author` field. Change the output option to `pdf`.\n\n-   Next, save the document as `Lab_04`. If you did it correctly, the file `Lab_04.qmd` should appear under the files section with a `.qmd` extension.\n\n## [Packages]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWe will need the following packages in today's lab:\n\n-   ***openintro:*** contains some of the data sets that we will use.\n-   ***tidyverse:*** contains the `ggplot2` package.\n\nCreate a code chunk and load the following packages using the code below. Be sure to hit the green button to run the packages.\n\n``` toml\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n## [Loading the Data]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWe will need the following data sets: `duke_forest` and `sinusitis` both contained in the openintro package. Load the data sets using the commands below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(duke_forest)\ndata(sinusitis)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nBefore you proceed, examine these data to understand their context. You may run the command `?duke_forest` and `?sinusitis` to learn more about the data sets.\n\n## [Visualizing Numerical Data]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\n### [One Numerical Variable]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWhen we have a single numerical variable, we can use tools such as `dot plots`, `histograms`, and `box plots` to visualize the distribution of the variable.\n\n#### [Dot Plot]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nThere are three basic steps in creating visualizations using the `ggplot2()` function. This function can take several arguments. The three basic steps are:\n\n-   ***Step 1:*** Add the data argument. Create a new code chunk and run the code below. What do you notice?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   ***Step 2:*** Add a mapping argument. This step defines how variables should be mapped on the axes. Since we are dealing with one variable here (price), we will just use the $x-axis$. See code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   **Step 3:** Define the visual properties. To define the visual properties, we use the `geom_**` (short form for geometry) function. In our case, we want to use dotplot and so we **add** the function `geom_dotplot()`. Notice that you must have the parentheses because this is a function that can take more arguments (you will learn more about this) to further define the nature of the dots added.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_dotplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can further customize the dots by adding arguments inside the `geom_dotplot()` function. For example, we can use a blue color for the dots and fill them in using orange color as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_dotplot(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can also change the size of dots by adding the argument dotsize. For example, we can set the size of the dots to 0.5 as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_dotplot(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\", dotsize = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can also change the appearance of the canvas by changing the theme. The most commonly used theme is the minimal theme. To add this theme, just add the `theme_minimal()` function. This will remove the gray background and gridlines. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_dotplot(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\", dotsize = 0.5) +\n       theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### [Histogram]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nAnother tool we can use to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable is a histogram. To create a histogram for the `price` variable, we follow the exact same steps as above but only change the `geom_dotplot` part to `geom_histogram`. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can further customize the histogram by adding arguments inside the `geom_histogram()` function. For example, we can change the color of the bars to blue and fill them in using ornage color as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_histogram(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can also change the binwidth of the histogram by adding the argument `binwidth`. For example, we can set the binwidth to 100,000 as shown below. Notice that we do not have a comma in the number 100 000.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_histogram(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\", binwidth = 100000)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### [Boxplot]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWe can also create a boxplot in the same way but change the geometry to `geom_boxplot`. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x=price)\n       ) + \n       geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can further customize the boxplot by adding arguments inside the `geom_boxplot()` function. For example, we can change the color of the lines to blue and fill in the box using orange color as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x=price)\n       ) + \n       geom_boxplot(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n***Question:***\n\n-   By examining the tools created above, how would you describe the distribution of the prices? What is the advantage of dot plot over the histogram? What about the box plot over the histogram?\n\n### [Two Numerical Variables]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\n#### [Scatter Plots]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nIn many cases, we want to assess relationships between two numerical variables. A scatter plot is the most commonly used visualization tool for this. To create a scatter plot, you just need to specify the variable on the $x-axis$ and the one on the $y-axis$. In addition, you will use `geom_point` as the geometry.\n\nSuppose we want to assess the association between `price` and `area`. Use the code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = area, y = price)\n       ) + \n       geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n***Question*** - What pattern do you notice from the above scatter plot? Is this what you expected?\n\nYou can add some layer of complexity to the scatter plot to allow you compare three variables. For example, you may want to compare the relationship between price and area by cooling. To do this, you use the color argument as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x=area, y = price, color = cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n***Question*** - What patterns do you notice above? What can you say about the relationship between price and area by cooling?\n\n## [Visualizing Categorical Data]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\n### [Single categorical Variable]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nYou can visualize a single categorical variable using tools such as simple bar plots and pie charts. However, pie charts are not recommended because they are not easy to interpret, especially when the frequencies are close. We will focus on bar plots.\n\n#### [Simple Bar Plots]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nThe data set `sinusitis` contains two categorical variables (`group` and `self_reported_improvement`). Suppose we want to visualize the distribution of cases by `self_reported_improvement`. We follow the same structure as above but change the `geom()` part to `geom_bar()`. See code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = sinusitis, \n       mapping = aes(x = self_reported_improvement)\n       ) + \n       geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou may want to color the bars so that each category shows a different color. You can do this by using adding the argument `fill=` in the `aes`. This will automatically fill the bars using some colors. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = sinusitis, \n       mapping = aes(x = self_reported_improvement, fill = self_reported_improvement)\n       ) + \n       geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### [Pie Chart]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nA pie chart can be seen as a special type of bar plot. Let us create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of the `self_reported_improvement` variable in the `sinusitis` data set. Study the code below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(sinusitis %>% count(self_reported_improvement), aes(x = \"\", y = n, fill = self_reported_improvement)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") + \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Groups in Sinusitis Dataset\", fill = \"Group\") +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### [Two Categorical Variables]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWe can use stacked bar plots or side-by-side bar plots to visualize two categorical variables. For example, we may want to visualize the relationship between `group` and `self_reported_improvement` from the `sinuisitis` data set.\n\n#### [Stacked Bar Plots]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nWhen you have multiple categorical variables, a stacked bar plot can be a nice way to visualize the relationship between them. For example, we can visualize the relationship between `self_reported_improvement` and `group` by simply using the second variable (in this case `group`) in the `fill` argument inside the `aes()`. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=sinusitis, \n       mapping = aes(x = self_reported_improvement, fill = group)\n       ) +\n       geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs you can see, stacked bar plots are not easy to interpret. If the bars are placed side-by-side, it becomes easier to interpret.\n\n#### [Side-by-side Bar plots]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nTo create a side-by-side by plot, we simply add the argument `position=dodge` in the `geom()` function. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = sinusitis, \n       mapping = aes(x = self_reported_improvement, fill = group)\n       ) +\n       geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## [Numerical variable by Category]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\nIt is common to find bar plots that compare a numerical variable across levels of a categorical variable using a specified summary statistic such as the mean or the raw scores. For example, if you wanted to visualize the mean `price` across the type of `cooling` for the houses in the `duke_forest` data set, we can do this by declaring a `statistic` inside the `geom_bar()` as shown below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = cooling, y = price/1000, fill=cooling)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun=\"mean\") +\n  labs(x = \"Type of Cooling\", \n       y = \"Average House Price in thousands\", \n       title = \"Bar Plot for Average price by Type of Cooling\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can also visualize the distribution of the `price` variable across the `cooling` without summarizing the `price` variable. To achieve this, we can use a side-by-side box plot. See below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = cooling, y = price/1000, fill = cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_boxplot(position = \"dodge\") +\n       labs(x = \"Type of Cooling\", \n            y = \"House Price in thousands\", \n            title = \"Box Plot for House Price by Type of Cooling\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can also create density plots to visualize the distribution of the `price` variable by `cooling`. To do this, we use the `geom_density()` function. Study the code below before running it. Change the value of the `alpha` argument to 0.9 to see what happens.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = duke_forest, \n       mapping = aes(x = price/1000, fill = cooling)\n       ) + \n       geom_density(alpha = .5) +\n       labs(x = \"House Price in thousands\", \n            y = \"Density\", \n            title = \"Density Plot for House Price by Type of Cooling\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## [Exercises]{style=\"color:#4166f5;\"}\n\n***Instructions:***\n\n-   Create a new quarto document and save it as lab_04_Exe. As for the title, use `Data Visualization with ggplot2 Exercises`. Write your name under the `Author` field. Change the output option to `pdf`.\n\n-   Delete everything on the page except the YAML. Then, load the `openintro` and `tidyverse` packages. Make sure to use `include=FALSE` in the code chunk for packages.\n\n-   Copy and paste each question into the document and have a code chunk below the question if it needs code to answer.\n\n-   Once you are done, render your document to PDF and submit the pdf on Canvas.\n\n***Questions:***\n\n1.  **(2 pts)** There is a data set called `loan50` contained in the `openintro` package. Load the data set into your quarto work space. Run the query `?loan50` in the console to learn more about the data then give a brief ***description*** of the data set. List any two categorical variables and any two numerical variables in the data set.\n\n2.  **(4 pts)** Create a simple ***bar plot*** to visualize the distribution of the variable `loan_purpose`. Based on your bar plot, what is the most frequent reason for which people in the sample took loans? What is the least frequent reason(s)? <br> ***NOTE:*** You may want to flip the coordinates to have the bars along the y-axis instead of the x-axis. This will provide more space for all categories to appear.\n\n3.  **(4 pts)** Create a ***dot plot*** to visualize the distribution of the variable `loan_amount`. Comment on the distribution.\n\n4.  **(4 pts)** Suppose we want to answer the question, \"do people with higher `total_income` tend to have higher `loan_amount`?. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `loan_amount` and `total_income`. Describe this relationship.\n\n5.  **(4 pts)** Create a new ***scatter plot*** that colors the dots on the scatter plot in question 5 above using the categorical variable `has_second_income` (i.e., whether someone has a second income or not). Comment on the new scatter plot.\n\n6.  Create a ***contingency table*** to summarize the counts of the variables `loan_status` and `home_ownership`. Comment on this table.
